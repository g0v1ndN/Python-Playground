## About:
Welcome to my repository of fun Python projects for beginners! I created this repository to store the code for some of the projects I worked on when I was learning Python programming. These projects helped me practice different aspects of Python, such as working with strings, lists, loops and functions.

## Usage Instructions:

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3 Installation: To execute the code provided in this repository, ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
- Basic Python Knowledge: Having a foundational understanding of Python programming is beneficial. Concepts like variables, data types, control structures, functions, and loops will be helpful in comprehending the code.
- Choice of Development Environment: You can use any preferred development environment or Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to run the code.

### Downloading or Cloning the Repository:
1. Click on the "Code" button on the top right corner of this repository page.
2. Click on "Download ZIP" to download a compressed zip file of the repository.
3. Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder on your computer.

<p align="center"><b> OR </b></p>

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
2. Run the command `git clone https://github.com/g0v1ndN/Python-Playground` to clone the repository to your local machine.
<p><b>Note:</b> You need to have Git installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed, please download and install Git from the official website (https://git-scm.com).</p>

### Steps for executing:
1. Open your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) on your computer.
2. Click on "File" and then "Open" to browse for and open the Python program file.
3. Tailor the code to your specific needs and save any changes that you make to the code.
4. Run the Python program by clicking on "Run" or "Execute" in the IDE's menu, or by using a shortcut key. The program's output should appear in the IDE's console or output window.

<p align="center"><b> OR </b></p>

1. Use a terminal on your computer to navigate to the directory where the Python program is located (using the cd command).
2. Open the Python program file in a text editor of your choice.
3. Tailor the code to your specific needs and save any changes that you make to the code.
4. Run the Python program by typing `python3 programname.py` into the terminal, where `programname.py` is the name of the Python file you want to run.
5. Press Enter to run the program. The program's output should appear in the terminal. 

## Programs:
### <a href="https://github.com/g0v1ndN/Python-Playground/blob/main/Simple%20Calculator.py">1. Simple Calculator</a>
This simple calculator project is an excellent starting point for beginners to learn concepts such as user input, function definitions, and conditional statements. 
### <a href="https://github.com/g0v1ndN/Python-Playground/blob/main/Number%20Guessing%20Game.py">2. Number Guessing Game</a>
In this number guessing game, you have 10 tries to guess a secret number between 1 and 100. Each time you guess, you'll get a hint whether your guess was too high or too low.
### <a href="https://github.com/g0v1ndN/Python-Playground/blob/main/Password%20Generator.py">3. Password Generator</a>
This Python password generator allows you to create passwords of any length you want. You can also customize your password with numbers and special characters for added security.
### <a href="https://github.com/g0v1ndN/Python-Playground/blob/main/Hangman%20Game.py">4. Hangman Game</a>
This simple yet addictive game uses ASCII to bring the game to life. But instead of random words, the word dictionary includes terminologies from computer science, challenging your knowledge of programming concepts while having fun.
### <a href="https://github.com/g0v1ndN/Python-Playground/blob/main/Contact%20Book.py">5. Contact Book</a>
This is a simple program designed to manage a list of contacts. Users can add new contacts, search for existing contacts, display all contacts, edit existing contacts, and delete existing contacts.
